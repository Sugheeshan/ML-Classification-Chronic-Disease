# 🩺 Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** based on patient health data. It aims to assist in early detection using supervised classification techniques.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

- Predicts whether a person is likely to have CKD using medical features
- Trained on a publicly available dataset
- Multiple ML models were tested and evaluated
- Helps in understanding the factors contributing to CKD

---

## 🧪 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle Machine Learning Repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mansoordaku/ckdisease/code)
- Contains 400 records and 26 features (e.g., blood pressure, sugar, albumin, hemoglobin)
- Target column: `classification` (ckd or notckd)

---

## 📊 Features Used

Some key features in the dataset:

- Age  
- Blood Pressure (`bp`)
